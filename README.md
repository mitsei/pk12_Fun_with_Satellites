# pk12_Fun_with_Satellites
What are maps? Why do they matter? What sorts of information can they convey? What types of maps can we generate from satellite data? This module explores how to understand the earth using open-source satellite data. Students will understand how maps can be analyzed to monitor crop health, measure deforestation and reforestation, or estimate amounts of carbon stockpiled in vegetation. Through projects, students will work with open-source satellite data (LandSat; Sentinel) to tell a geography-based story in images and devise a method of quantitative analysis to provide additional context.
